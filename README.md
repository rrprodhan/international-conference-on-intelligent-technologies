Analyzing and Evaluating Boosting-Based CNN Algorithms for Image Classification

![Conference Certificate](conference_certificate.png)

CNN is the most widely used method for image classification. In many occasions, its accuracy is improved by combining it with several boosting techniques. Determining such an efficient boosting model can be very time conserving and benevolent for many image classification applications. This study aims at analyzing and evaluating the performance of CNN added with various boosting techniques, namely XGBoost, Gradient Boost and AdaBoost. At first, CNN mode is trained, and image features are extracted by using convolutional layers, then for training the boosting algorithms intermediate data is extracted from three different layers of the CNN model. After comparing the performance of each individual techniques, it is revealed that boosted CNNs overperforms the others. While comparing the performances of the three CNN-Boosting algorithms, using data extracted from the flatten layer and the first dense layer, CNN-Gradient Boost performs better with an average of approximately 0.1921% more test accuracy and 0.2455% more F1 score for the flatten layer and 0.0505% more test accuracy and 0.0479% more F1 score for the first dense layer. For the third dense layer, CNN-XGBoost achieves better result with 0.0505% more test accuracy and 0.0479% more F1 score than the others. This finding is beneficial to improve performance of any application requiring image classification.
